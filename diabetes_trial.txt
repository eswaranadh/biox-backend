Title: Clinical Trial Results for GLP-1 Receptor Agonists in Type 2 Diabetes

Trial ID: NCT02648204
Phase: Phase 3
Status: Completed

Summary:
This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study included 1,200 participants across multiple centers.

Key Findings:
1. HbA1c Reduction:
- Mean reduction of 1.8% from baseline in the treatment group
- Placebo group showed 0.4% reduction
- Statistically significant difference (p<0.001)

2. Weight Loss:
- Average weight loss of 4.5 kg in treatment group
- Placebo group showed 1.2 kg loss
- Consistent with GLP-1's effect on appetite and satiety

3. Blood Pressure:
- Systolic BP reduction: 5.4 mmHg
- Diastolic BP reduction: 2.8 mmHg

Safety Profile:
- Most common adverse events: nausea (28%), diarrhea (15%)
- Serious adverse events: 3.2% (similar to placebo)
- No significant increase in hypoglycemia risk

Patient Demographics:
- Age range: 18-75 years
- Mean duration of diabetes: 8.3 years
- Baseline HbA1c: 7.5-11.0%
- 52% male, 48% female

Conclusion:
The trial demonstrated significant improvements in glycemic control and weight loss with an acceptable safety profile. Results support the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists as an effective treatment option for type 2 diabetes.
